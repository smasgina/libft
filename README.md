# libft — Custom C Standard Library

## Overview
`libft` is a foundational C library developed as part of the 42 Silicon Valley curriculum.  
The project recreates and extends essential parts of the C standard library, with a focus on low-level programming, memory management, and modular design.

This library is designed to be reused across future C projects and serves as a strong exercise in understanding how core C functions work under the hood.

---

## Key Concepts Implemented
- Manual memory management (`malloc`, `free`)
- Pointer arithmetic and pointer safety
- String manipulation and parsing
- Linked list data structures
- Modular and reusable function design
- Defensive programming and edge-case handling
- Debugging logical and memory-related errors

---

## Functionality
The library includes 50+ custom functions, such as:
- Character and string utilities
- Memory handling functions
- Conversion and output functions
- Singly linked list operations

---

## Compilation
To compile the library, run:

```bash
make
```

This will generate:

```bash
libft.a
```

You can then link it with your C projects:

```bash
gcc your_program.c -L. -lft
```

---

## Project Context
This project was completed in a self-directed, peer-to-peer learning environment with no formal lectures.  
All debugging, testing, and design decisions were handled independently, reinforcing strong problem-solving and engineering discipline.
